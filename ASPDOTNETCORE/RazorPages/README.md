## Objective
Create a RazorPages website to Create, Edit, Delete, and View Details on a list of movies kept in a local db

## Rating
⭐⭐⭐⭐

Goes through creating models, generating a RazorWeb page via a Visual Studio's scaffolded items, and goes in depth into exactly what was generated and how the files interact with one another. 

## Points of Interest
* Goes through RazorPages, which is essentially Angular but with C#. Writing C# code and integrates directly with HTML
* Create a website which reads entries from a database and allows the user to create/delete/edit/view those entries
* Create migrations after model changes for code-first generation
* Talks about good coding practices such as writing code in one place and having it apply everywhere (and how RazorPages applies that ideology)
