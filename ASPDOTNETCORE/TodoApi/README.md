## Objective
Create a simple ASP.NET Core web api with an InMemoryDatabase to back it

## Difficulty
Beginner. Very little manual coding done. This is pretty much just using the default Visual Studio ASP.NET Core project template and adding a few new classes into it. Good to get a feel for how the context interacts with the API Controller.

## Points of Interest
* Goes over basic CRUD operations included standard HTTP return types
* Uses Postman to interact with the API
* Touches on Entity Framework and linking entities to CRUD operations
